# GoldsteinGameTheory

Reannimation of Goldstein game theory model and evolutionary simulations. 

# Project structure 

## 1. RMarkdown file Goldstein_model_notes_plots.Rmd

- Summarizes the theory, plots theoretical fitness landscapes, and optimum responses. Directories need to be adjusted. 

- Plots simulation resutls. 

## 2. Python file Goldstein_simulations.py 

- Runs the simulations, saves the results to results folder. Adjust the directories to your own
and run in your convenient phython environment. 

- This is a simplified version based on the theory described in the manuscript draft. 

## Extras 

Original Java code from Goldstein called Simulations, in progress code of implementation of functions in the Java code called Java_implementation_trial.
